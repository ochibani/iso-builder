## ISO Builder

This ISO builder is fork of the good work from the elementary crew.  Many thanks to the devs there https://github.com/elementary/os

This unofficial repository contains the live-build configuration and scripts used to build a custom Debian ([Kicksecure](https://kicksecure.com) xfce & gnome) ISO image.

## Further Information

More information about the concepts behind `live-build` and the technical decisions made to arrive at this set of tools to build an .iso can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/elementary/os/wiki/Building-iso-Images).
